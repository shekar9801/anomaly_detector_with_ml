# anomaly_detector_with_ml Using IsolationForest Algorithm
Using python and any algorithm of your choice, highlight time periods where this abnormality can be observed.

# Problem Statement:

You are provided a dataset of a cyclone preheater which is part of an industrial process. In
the duration of operation there are instances of abnormal operations.
# Objective:
Using python and any algorithm of your choice, highlight time periods where this
abnormality can be observed.
About the data
There are 6 variables and 370k records. Data is recorded once every 5 minutes over a
duration of 3 years.
1. Cyclone_Inlet_Gas_Temp – Temperature of Hot gas entering the cyclone.
2. Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp – Temperature of Hot gas leaving the cyclone.
3. Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft – Draft (pressure) of gas at outlet of cyclone.
4. Cyclone_cone_draft – Draft (pressure) of gas at cone section of cyclone.
5. Cyclone_Inlet_Draft – Draft (pressure) of gas at inlet of cyclone
6. Cyclone_Material_Temp – Temperature of the material at the outlet of the cyclone.
# Expected Output:
Prepare a zip/rar folder with the following files and share with the Algo8's team, as
indicated. Name of the folder must be candidate’s “FirstName_LastName”
7. Provide the source code file/s of your work
8. A ppt with 3-5 slides detailing the following:
• Data preparation – What kind of treatment or processing did you apply on the raw
data possible. What was the reasoning behind your specific decisions?
• Analysis strategy – Detail the methodology you followed to analyze the data.
• Insights – What did you find out from the data provided. Where are the abnormal
periods and how did you identify them?
